Bolt app template
=================


[Bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt) is our framework that lets you build JavaScript-based Slack apps in a flash.

This project is a simple app template to make it easy to create your first Bolt app. Read our [Getting Started with Bolt](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt) guide for a more in-depth tutorial

Your Project
------------

- `app.js` contains the primary Bolt app. It imports the Bolt package (`@slack/bolt`) and starts the Bolt app's server. It's where you'll add your app's listeners.
- `.env` is where you'll put your Slack app's authorization token and signing secret.
- The `examples/` folder contains a couple of other sample apps that you can peruse to your liking. They show off a few platform features that your app may want to use.
